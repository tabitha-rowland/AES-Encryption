# AES-Encryption
This program will swap one or more blocks of ciphertext of a message with the respective blocks from a different ciphertext, demonstrating that when using ECB, block ciphers can easily be manipulated and forged. The project guide for this can be found [here](https://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs483/HW/AESProj.html)
